## What are Workspaces?
A workspace is a self-contained development environment, pre-configured with the projectâ€™s source code, required dependencies, necessary tools, and extensions to optimize workflow for your development team.

Daytona workspaces simplify the setup and configuration of development environments, integrate various tools, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure a consistent experience across different teams and projects. By following established practices and automation, Development Environment Management ensures that all developers have access to a consistent, secure, and standardized environment, ultimately enhancing productivity and streamlining the software development process.
